Solution to https://astrohack.org/

In the validation folder there is code + data for the validation phase.

In the full_test folder there is code + data for the full test phase.

The difference between the two is:

- a bug that would filter galaxies with 0 error only on a subset of the data was fixed
- training set size N=full instead of N=10K
- the submission is generated on the full test set instead of just validation
